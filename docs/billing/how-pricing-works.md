# How Pricing Works

Therativities uses a simple **pay-as-you-go** model. No monthly subscriptions, no contracts, no hidden fees.

## Per-session platform fee

You pay a small platform fee for each session you bill through Therativities. This fee is automatically deducted when processing payments through Stripe.

## Stripe processing fees

When collecting online payments from parents, standard Stripe processing fees apply:

| Payment method | Fee |
|----------------|-----|
| Credit/debit card | 2.9% + $0.30 per charge |
| ACH bank transfer | 0.8%, capped at $5.00 |

These fees are charged by Stripe, not Therativities. You can choose whether to absorb these fees or pass them to the parent in your billing settings.

## Fee handling options

In **Settings > Billing**, you can configure fee handling:

- **Therapist absorbs** — You pay the Stripe fees (parent pays the base session rate)
- **Pass to client** — Stripe fees are added to the parent's total

This can also be set per client in their billing settings.

## Manual payments

If you collect payment via cash, check, Zelle, Venmo, or other methods outside of Stripe, there are no processing fees. You simply record the payment in Therativities for your records.

## No monthly subscription

There is no monthly subscription fee. You only pay when you bill for sessions. If you don't bill in a given month, you don't pay anything.
