# Dashboard

The dashboard is your home screen when you log in. It gives you a real-time snapshot of your day and your practice.

## Status cards

Three cards appear at the top of your dashboard:

### Today's Sessions
Shows how many sessions you have scheduled today (excluding buffer blocks). On mobile, a date badge shows the current month and day.

### Sessions This Week
Displays your completion ratio — for example, **5/8** means you've completed 5 out of 8 scheduled sessions this week.

### Ready to Bill
Shows the total dollar amount and number of completed sessions that haven't been billed yet.

## Session timeline graph

Below the status cards, a visual graph shows your sessions over time:

- **Desktop**: 30-day view
- **Mobile**: 7-day view

Each bar is color-coded by session status:

| Color | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Blue (outlined) | Upcoming / Scheduled |
| Green (outlined) | Completed and billed |
| Yellow (outlined) | Completed but unbilled |
| Red (outlined) | Overdue — past the scheduled time but not completed |
| Orange (outlined) | Elapsed — awaiting completion |
| Gray | Cancelled or no-show |

A **Bill Week** button lets you batch-bill all eligible sessions for the week.

## Today's sessions

A list of all sessions scheduled for today. Each session card shows:

- **Client name**
- **Time range and duration**
- **Status badge** — Scheduled, Completed, In Progress, Cancelled, or No Show
- **Additional badges**:
  - "Needs Completion" (amber) — Session time has passed but it hasn't been marked complete
  - "Plan" (purple) — An upcoming session you can prepare for
  - 🔄 Recurring icon — Part of a recurring series

Session cards are color-coded to match the timeline graph. Click any session to open the session management page.

### Quick actions

Two buttons appear at the top of the Today's Sessions section:

- **Generate Activities** — Opens the AI batch activity generator for all of today's sessions
- **Bill Today** — Opens the batch billing modal for today's completed sessions

### Empty state

If you have no sessions scheduled, you'll see a calendar icon with "No sessions today."
