# AI Tools

Therativities uses AI to reduce your documentation burden so you can focus on therapy. Every AI-generated output is editable — you always have the final say.

## Activity generation

### Per-session generation

From the session management page, click **Generate Activities** to have AI plan your session activities.

The AI considers:
- The child's current short-term goals
- Session duration and structure
- Your available materials (from your material bags)
- The child's interests (from their profile)
- Past activity performance — if you've rated activities before, the AI learns what works

Each generated activity includes:
- Title and description
- Suggested duration
- Materials needed
- Goals targeted
- Segment placement (e.g., "Warm-up", "Main Activity", "Cool-down")
- Personalization notes

### Daily batch generation

From the dashboard, click **Generate Today's Activities** to plan activities for all of your sessions at once:

1. Select which **material bags** you brought today
2. Review the sessions to generate for
3. Click **Generate All Activities**
4. Activities are saved to each session automatically

This is especially useful in the morning to prep your entire day.

## SOAP notes generation

After running a session and completing activities, click **Generate SOAP** to create structured clinical notes.

The AI generates all four SOAP fields:
- **Subjective** — Client's reported experience
- **Objective** — Observable behaviors and measurements
- **Assessment** — Clinical interpretation and progress analysis
- **Plan** — Next steps and recommendations

The AI is trained as a clinical documentation expert with knowledge of OT, PT, SLP, and behavioral therapy documentation standards.

## Parent summary generation

Click **Generate Summary** on the Parent Summary tab to create a parent-friendly recap of the session.

You can configure the output style in Settings:
- **Length**: Short (1–3 sentences), Medium (4–6 sentences), or Detailed (8–12 sentences)
- **Tone**: Casual (conversational) or Professional (clear and warm)

The summary uses the correct pronouns based on the child's profile.

## Goal generation

From the **Goals & Treatment** tab on a client's profile:

- Click **Generate Goals** to create structured long-term goals with short-term objectives
- Use **Brain Dump** to speak or type unstructured clinical observations, and the AI will organize them into properly structured goals
- Brain dump history is tracked so you can build on previous observations over time

## Evaluation reports

When creating an evaluation:

1. Upload clinical observations, test scores, and parent intake forms
2. Select a discipline-specific template (OT, PT, SLP)
3. Fill in the guided sections
4. Click **Generate Report** — AI creates a comprehensive evaluation report
5. Edit in the canvas editor with rich text formatting
6. Use the verification system to review and approve AI-generated content

Additional features:
- **Template builder** for custom report structures
- **Style guide generation** for a consistent clinical voice
- **Document extraction** from uploaded PDFs and DOCX files

## Progress notes

When completing a session, check the **Progress Note** option to generate a multi-session progress summary. The AI reviews all sessions since the last progress note and creates a comprehensive update including progress toward goals, challenges, and recommendations.
