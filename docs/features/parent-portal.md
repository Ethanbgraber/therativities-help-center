# Parent Portal

The Parent Portal gives parents visibility into their child's therapy progress, upcoming sessions, and billing — without needing to contact the therapist for updates.

## How parents get access

Parents don't sign up on their own. Instead, the therapist sends an invitation:

1. **Therapist** opens the client's profile → **Guardian Info** tab
2. Clicks **Invite to Dashboard** next to the guardian's name
3. An email is sent to the parent with a link to accept the invitation
4. **Parent** clicks the link, creates an account (or signs in), and is connected to their child's record

The invitation email includes:
- Therapist's name
- Child's name
- A direct link to accept

:::tip
Make sure the guardian's email address is correct before sending the invitation. The parent will use this email to create their account.

## What parents can see

### Overview dashboard

After logging in, parents see:
- **Total Children** — Number of children connected to their account
- **Active Treatment** — Children currently receiving therapy
- **Upcoming** — Sessions scheduled in the next 7 days
- **This Week** — Sessions this week

### Pending intake forms

If the therapist has sent intake forms, they appear here with a progress bar. Parents can start or continue filling them out.

### Children table

A list of all connected children with their next session, last session, and status.

## Child details

Clicking a child opens their profile with these tabs:

| Tab | What it shows |
|-----|---------------|
| Overview | Session stats and recent activity |
| Sessions | Past and upcoming sessions with dates, times, and status |
| Child Info | Basic profile information (read-only) |
| Guardian Info | Guardian contact details (read-only) |
| Documents | Shared documents |
| Account History | Activity log |
| Payment Methods | Manage credit/debit cards for billing |

### What parents can NOT see

- Goals & Treatment plans (therapist only)
- Evaluations (therapist only)
- Clinical Details (therapist only)
- Service Details (therapist only)
- Access & Permissions (therapist only)

## Parent calendar

Parents have a calendar view showing sessions for all their children. It supports the same views as the therapist calendar (Day, 3-Day, Work Week, Week, Month).

Each session shows:
- Child's name
- Date, time, and duration
- Therapist's name
- Session status

## Requesting a cancellation

Parents cannot cancel sessions directly. If the therapist allows cancellation requests, parents can:

1. Click **Request Cancellation** on an upcoming session
2. Optionally provide a reason
3. The request is sent to the therapist for approval
4. The parent sees "Pending Cancellation" status until the therapist responds

## Payment methods

Parents can manage their payment methods from the **Payment Methods** tab on their child's profile:
- Add a new credit or debit card
- Set a default payment method
- Remove saved cards

## Parent settings

Parents have a simplified settings page with:
- **Account & Profile** — Name, email, password
- **Notification Preferences** — Control which notifications to receive
- **Payment Methods** — Manage cards per child
