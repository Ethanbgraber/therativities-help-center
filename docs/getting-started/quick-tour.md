# Quick Tour

Here's a walkthrough of the main areas you'll use every day in Therativities.

## Dashboard

Your home screen after logging in. At a glance, you'll see:

- **Today's Sessions** — Count of sessions scheduled for today
- **Sessions This Week** — How many you've completed vs. how many are scheduled (e.g., "5/8")
- **Ready to Bill** — Total dollar amount and number of sessions ready to be billed

Below the stats, a **session timeline graph** shows your sessions over the past 30 days (7 days on mobile), color-coded by status:

| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Blue | Upcoming / Scheduled |
| Green | Completed and billed |
| Yellow | Completed but unbilled |
| Red | Overdue (past scheduled time, not completed) |
| Gray | Cancelled or no-show |

Further down, **Today's Sessions** lists each session with the client name, time, duration, and status. You can click any session to open it.

Quick actions from the dashboard:
- **Generate Activities** — Use AI to plan activities for all of today's sessions at once
- **Bill Today** — Batch-bill all completed sessions from today

## Clients

Your client list shows every client with columns for:
- Client name
- Next session
- Last session
- Past sessions needing review
- Status (In Session, Scheduled, Not Scheduled)

Click a client to open their full profile with tabs for overview, sessions, goals, clinical details, billing, and more.

## Calendar

View your schedule in multiple formats:
- **Day** — Hour-by-hour view of a single day
- **3-Day** — Three days side by side
- **Work Week** — Monday through Friday
- **Week** — Full Sunday through Saturday
- **Month** — Monthly overview

Click any time slot to book a new session, or click an existing session to view/edit it.

## Session Management

When you open a session, you'll see a split view:
- **Left panel** — Activities (AI-generated or manual)
- **Right panel** — Notes (Draft, SOAP, and Parent Summary tabs)

This is where you run your sessions, document progress, and generate notes. See [Documentation & Notes](/features/documentation) for details.

## Settings

Access all configuration through the gear icon. Everything from your profile and licenses to scheduling rules, billing, and team management lives here.
