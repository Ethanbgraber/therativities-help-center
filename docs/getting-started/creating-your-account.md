## Step 1: Sign up

1. Go to [app.therativities.com](https://app.therativities.com)
2. Click **Create New Account**
3. Sign up with your Google account or create an account with your email and password
4. Verify your email if signing up with email

## Step 2: Choose your role

After signing in for the first time, you'll be asked to choose your role:

If you're a parent, you don't need to create an account on your own. Your child's therapist will send you an invitation email with a link to get started. See [Parent Portal](/features/parent-portal) for details.
