# Setting Up Your Practice

After creating your account, a floating **setup checklist** appears in the bottom-right corner of your screen. It tracks 14 items — 12 required and 2 optional — to get your practice fully configured.

## Required setup items

### 1. Basic Profile Info
Your name, email, and phone number. These were entered during signup, so this should already be complete.

### 2. Professional Credentials
Your credentials suffix (e.g., OTR/L, PT, DPT, SLP). This appears on documents and super bills.

### 3. Professional Licenses
At least one license with your license number and state. You can add multiple licenses if you're licensed in multiple states.

### 4. Business Information
- **NPI Number** — Your National Provider Identifier
- **TIN Number** — Your Tax Identification Number

These are used for super bills and insurance documentation.

### 5. Practice Address
Your practice location (street, city, state, ZIP). This appears on invoices and documents.

### 6. Provider Signature
Draw your signature on the signature pad. This is used on documents and super bills. An audit trail is automatically recorded (device info, timestamp).

### 7. Security PIN
Set a PIN to protect sensitive information within the app.

### 8. Platform Payment Method
Add a credit or debit card for Therativities platform fees. This is separate from your Stripe account for collecting client payments.

### 9. Connect Stripe Account
Connect your Stripe account to accept payments from parents. This launches Stripe's onboarding flow where you'll enter your business and banking details. See [Payment Processing](/billing/payment-processing) for more.

### 10. Session Services
Add at least one session service with a name and rate (e.g., "OT Session — $150/hr"). These appear as options when scheduling and billing sessions.

### 11. Billing Frequency
Choose how often sessions are billed: Immediate, Weekly, Bi-monthly, or Monthly.

### 12. Fee Policy
Configure how Stripe processing fees are handled — whether you absorb them or pass them to the client.

## Optional setup items

### 13. Evaluation Services
Add evaluation services if you perform evaluations (e.g., "OT Evaluation — $350").

### 14. Add First Client
Add your first client to start using the platform. See [Client Management](/features/client-management) for a full guide.

## Accessing settings later

All of these settings are available anytime under **Settings** (gear icon). The settings page has 11 tabs:

- Account
- Calendar
- Profile
- Notifications
- Privacy & Security
- Scheduling Rules
- Sessions
- Documents
- Evaluations
- Organizations & Access
- Billing

The setup checklist disappears once all required items are complete, but you can always adjust your configuration from Settings.
