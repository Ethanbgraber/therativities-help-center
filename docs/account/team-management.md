# Team Management

If you work with other therapists, Therativities supports multi-therapist practices through **entities** (organizations).

## What is an entity?

An entity represents your practice or organization. When you sign up as a solo therapist, a **solo practice entity** is created for you automatically (named "[Your Name] - Solo Practice").

If you work with a team, you can create a **therapist group** entity and invite other therapists to join.

## Entity types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Solo Therapist | A single therapist practice (created automatically at signup) |
| Therapist Group | A practice with multiple therapists |

## Creating a new entity

1. Go to **Settings > Organizations & Access > Entity Management**
2. Click **Create New Entity**
3. Enter:
   - **Entity Name** — Your practice or organization name
   - **Entity Type** — Solo Therapist or Therapist Group
4. Click **Create Entity**

You become the admin and member of the new entity automatically.

## Adding team members

As an admin, you can invite other therapists to your entity:

1. Click **Add Member**
2. Enter their **email address** (they must already have a Therativities account)
3. Optionally check **Make Admin** to give them admin privileges
4. Click **Add Member**

The member is added immediately and can switch to your entity to see shared clients.

## Member roles

| Role | Can do |
|------|--------|
| **Member** | View and manage clients within the entity |
| **Admin** | Everything a member can do, plus add/remove members, manage entity settings, and configure access |

## Removing a member

Admins can remove any member except themselves:
1. Find the member in the member list
2. Click **Remove**
3. Confirm the removal

## Switching between entities

If you belong to multiple entities (e.g., your solo practice and a group practice):

1. Go to **Settings > Organizations & Access > Entity Management**
2. Your current active entity shows a green **Active** badge
3. Click **Switch to This Entity** on any other entity

When you switch entities, the app filters to show only the clients, sessions, and data associated with that entity.

## Client access control

Each entity maintains its own data per client. You can control what different entities and team members can see:

### Access levels

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| No Access | Cannot view the client |
| View Only | Can see client information but not edit |
| Can Edit | Full read and write access |

### Setting access

- **Default access level** — Set in entity settings (applies to all new clients)
- **Per-user overrides** — Override the default for specific team members from the client's **Access & Permissions** tab

### Requesting access to a client

If another entity needs access to one of your clients:
1. They submit an **Access Request** from the client's Access tab
2. You (or the parent) receive a notification
3. Approve or deny the request
4. If approved, the entity is granted access
